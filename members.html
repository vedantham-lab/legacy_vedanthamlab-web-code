        <h3>Vasanth Vedantham</h3>
        <h4>Principal Investigator</h4>
        <p>Vasanth received undergraduate degrees from Yale University in physics and biochemistry, an MD from the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology Program, and a PhD from the Program in Neuroscience at Harvard University. His dissertation research in the lab of Stephen Cannon used chemical modification and electrophysiological recording to define structure-function relationships that govern gating, pharmacology, and toxin binding in voltage-gated sodium channels. After completing clinical training in internal medicine, cardiology, and cardiac electrophysiology, his postdoctoral work in the lab of Deepak Srivastava at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease explored transcriptional networks in the cardiac conduction system.</p>
        <p>In 2010, Vasanth joined the faculty at UCSF as a cardiac electrophysiologist with a mentored basic research position at Gladstone as a K08 awardee in Deepak Srivastava’s Lab.</p>
        <p>In 2017, Vasanth started his independent lab within the Cardiovascular Research Institute at UCSF. The lab is exploring development, physiology, and evolution of heart rhythm from a multidisciplinary perspective, with the ultimate aim of developing novel therapies for arrhythmias that are grounded in science and informed by clinical need. </p>
        <p>Vasanth is also a practicing clinical cardiac electrophysiologist at UCSF with particular interests in inherited arrhythmia syndromes and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, especially cardiac sarcoidosis.</p>

        <h3>Giselle Galang</h3>
        <h4>Lab Manager</h4>
        <p>Giselle received her undergraduate degree in microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics from UCLA. She has previously worked in cardiovascular research in the labs of Dr. Kenneth Philipson at UCLA and Dr. Eduardo Marban at Cedars-Sinai. Since 2012, she has been working with Dr. Vedantham and has been the lab manager since 2017.</p>

        <h3>Hongmei Ruan</h3>
        <h4>Specialist</h4>
        <p>Hongmei received an MD from North-China Coal Medical College, followed by an MS in Cardiovascular Physiology and a PhD in Cardiovascular Pharmacology at Zhongshan University in China. Over the past 30 years, her research has been focused on cardiomyocyte biology and physiology in heart disease, with particular emphasis on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmias. She worked as a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Yibin Wang at UCLA, and later joined the group as a research scientist. She is a past recipient of an AHA postdoctoral fellowship and scientist development grant during her time at UCLA. Hongmei joined the lab in 2017, and (among other projects) currently leads our efforts in whole animal and cellular electrophysiology, including whole cell patch clamp of isolated cardiac pacemaker cells, ex-vivo electrophysiology studies in isolated mouse hearts, and surgical implantation of transmitters for in-vivo electrocardiography. </p>

        <h3>Prasanna Allu</h3>
        <h4>Postdoctoral Fellow</h4>
        <p>Prasanna received an undergraduate degree from Loyola College and a Ph.D. from the Department of Biotechnology at the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras, India. He completed his dissertation research in the lab of Dr. Nitish Mahapatra, where he defined functional changes that are associated with genetic variation of the dysglycemic peptide pancreastatin in Indian populations. Prasanna received several honors and awards during his undergraduate and doctoral training including CSIR-UGC doctoral fellowship from the Government of India. His initial postdoctoral work in the lab of Dr. David Pearce at UCSF explored mTOR signaling in adipose tissues. Prasanna joined the lab in 2017, and is focused on understanding transcriptional networks in cardiac pacemaker cells using mouse models. He has received an AHA postdoctoral fellowship to support this work.</p>

        <h3>Ravi Mandla</h3>
        <h4>Junior Specialist</h4>
        <p>Ravi received an undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley in Molecular and Cell Biology and Edcation. He currently works on better understanding the epigenetic regulations involved in the development of pacemaker cells, using both computational and molecular biology techniques to do so. He is also interested in better understanding how these regulatory pathways have changed throughout evolution, and how these changes can be implemented into better patient therapies.</p>

          <h3>James Engel</h3>
          <h4>Postdoctoral Fellow</h4>
          <p>James received his B.S. in Human Biology and M.S. in Biology from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). During his time at UCSD his research in Dr. Jack Dixon’s lab was focused on studying the biochemistry of novel phosphatases and secreted kinases. He then received his Ph.D in Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Physiology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the lab of Dr. Reza Ardehali where he studied the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to heart field specific cardiomyocytes for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. James was selected to participate in the Amgen Postdoctoral Program and will be collaboratively mentored in the Vedantham Lab at UCSF CVRI and at the Amgen South San Francisco Campus. </p>
